 * When the component is attached, it gets the number of items in the user's cart.
 * We set numItems to the component local data for the shopping cart icon to render with a quantity.
 * On addToCart(), increase numItems locally +=x and will be updated and itemID will be uploaded to the cloud database
 * 
 * When the user clicks on the cartIcon, will set global variable 'itemNotAdded' to true which will be
 *     read by shoppingCart.js to not wait for the global variable 'itemAddedComplete' which is true once item is added
